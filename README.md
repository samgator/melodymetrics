# Melody Metrics
Get song recommendations based on your favorite genres.

## Running the Program
Our program was developed in VSCode using the Live Server extension. This is the best way to ensure that the code works on your end.
Additionally, you may access our website via our link: [Melody Metrics](https://melodymetrics.netlify.app/)

## Signing in with Spotify
Our app for the Spotify API is currently in development mode since it was created for personal use. We must add you as a user with the *email address* associated with your **Spotify account** to allow you to sign in. 

### Note
Signing in to your Spotify account with Google is not supported when running our program with a Live Server. To sign in with Google, you **must** use our [link](https://melodymetrics.netlify.app/). Signing in with a regular Spotify account with the Live Server works just fine, though.
