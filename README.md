## Running the Program
Our program was developed in VSCode using the Live Server extension. This is the best way to ensure that the code works on your end.

## Signing in with Spotify
Our app for the Spotify API is currently in development mode since it was created for personal use. We must add you as a user with the *email address* associated with your **Spotify account** to allow you to sign in. Additionally, signing into Spotify with your Google account is not supported at this time.
